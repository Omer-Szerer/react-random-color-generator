# React Random Color Generator

Design and develop a random color generator web application using React. This application will show a random color when a button is clicked.

TODOs:
[x] Create a "Generate" button
[x] Create a div that contains the text "Generated Color: <background color hex code>"
[x] Generate a random hex color (use "randomcolor" library?)
[x] Connect between the color generated by the button to the div background
[x] Connect between the color generated by the button to the div text (same hex code)

Stretch:
[x] Add "Want more control?" text and the possibility to specify hue and luminosity
[x] Add placeholder text to make it clear (e.g. red/green/blue and Light/Dark)
[ ] Use a CSS-in-JS library for all styling (eg. Emotion or Styled Components)
[x] Center align all the different elements (like in the Figma file)
[x] Transition smoothly between the colors as they change
[ ] Allow user to specify size for the color box
